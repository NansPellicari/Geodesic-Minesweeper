# Minesweeper

clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/NansPellicari/Geodesic-Minesweeper.git Minesweeper
git submodule init
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For now, my test environment (with GoogleTest) works only with a source build of the Unreal Engine.  
To make it works with the standard version 4.26, you can the dedicated branch.  
I need to dig more in the Engine builder to find why.

It is the default branch but just in case:

```
git checkout v4.26
```

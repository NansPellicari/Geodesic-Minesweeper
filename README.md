# Minesweeper

clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/NansPellicari/Geodesic-Minesweeper.git Minesweeper
```

For now, my test environment (with GoogleTest) works only with a source build of the Unreal Engine.  
To make it works with a standard version (eg. 4.26), you need to remove the GoogleTestApp target and uproject files.  
I need to dig more in the Engine builder to find why.
